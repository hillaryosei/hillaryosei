# Hi There! 👋🏾

## About Me 

☺️ I'm Hillary, an aspiring full-stack developer. I'm currently pursuing post-baccleaurate studies at NYU Tandon's Bridge to Computer Science program during the Summer 2022 term. Additionally, I am doing self-paced web development lessons through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)!

🎊 Outside of tech/coding, I love listening to music and watching all things Marvel.
